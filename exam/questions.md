1. Explain how reinforcement learning differs from supervised and unsupervised learning in terms of the type of input the learning algorithms use to improve model performance. [5]

1. Explain why we need separate training and test data. What is generalization, and how does the concept relate to underfitting and overfitting? [10]

1. Define the three key components of Mitchell's definition of machine learning (Task $T$, Performance measure $P$, and Experience $E$). Give a concrete example for each component in the context of email spam classification. [10]

1. Explain the difference between classification and regression tasks. For each task type, provide: (a) the mathematical representation of the target variable, (b) a real-world example, and (c) one appropriate evaluation metric. [10]

1. Define the prediction function of a *linear regression* model and write down $L^2$-regularized mean squared error loss. [10]

1. Starting from the unregularized sum of squares error of a linear regression model, show how the explicit solution can be obtained, assuming $\boldsymbol X^T \boldsymbol X$ is invertible. [10]
